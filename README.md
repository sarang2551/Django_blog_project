# Django_blog_project

This is a simple blog app that I started in order to get a better understanding of Django.
(Having only worked with React prior to this)

Features:
1. Creating/Deleting/Updating blogs
2. Publishing blogs (Leaving them as drafts)
3. Sharing blogs using email
4. Tagging posts
5. Filtering posts based on tags
